What I have learnt till now:

* Theory, math and evolution of machine learning 
* How to code a single layer perceptron from scratch for a classification task - this involved creating a loss function, dealing with forward and backward propagation, and finally training the perceptron using the above
* Basics of PyTorch, how to use the library in python for a classification task using the MNIST dataset
